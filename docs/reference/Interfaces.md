# Interfaces

An interface is useful for declaring a set of messages to be understood by the
objects implementing it.

> It's not intended to be used as some kind of static type check, but to

Once you have an interface you can ask it if some object is implementing it:

```smalltalk
| interface |
interface := Interface named: 'Assertable' declaring: #( #assert: #deny: ).
interface isImplementedBy: 1
```

will return `false`

You can also ask it if an instance of some class will implement it:

```smalltalk
| interface |
interface := Interface named: 'Assertable' declaring: #( #assert: #deny: ).
interface isImplementedByInstancesOf: TestCase
```

will return `true`
